## How to use the proxies

To use the proxies in this list, you will need to have a software or script that supports proxy connections. Some examples include:

- [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/connection-settings-firefox)
- [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95617)
- [curl](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html)
- [Python requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/advanced/#proxies)

Once you have a program that supports proxy connections, you can copy and paste the IP address and port number of the proxy server into the settings of the program.

## Sample Proxies

Here are some sample proxies from the `http.txt`, `socks4.txt`, and `socks5.txt` files:
